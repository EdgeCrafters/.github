# EdgeCrafters: Edged Judger Platform (EJP)

## Introduction
Welcome to the home of EdgeCrafters!
We are the creators of the Edged Judger Platform (EJP). Our primary mission is to lower the barriers to coding education.
EJP is an edge computing-based assignment grading (Judger) service, allowing educators to manage students' coding assignments without the need for high-cost server setup or external platform subscription. 

## Background
As the significance of software education has become prominent, the essence of hands-on 'practice' in software teaching is undeniable.
Previous platforms have their own online judger services, enhancing the quality and accessibility of coding education.
However, these services still possess limitations.

Traditional online judger services often rely on web-based structures, asking users to code and submit through their web IDEs.
This isn't always ideal, especially for complex assignments that involve multiple source files and build-link processes.
Such tasks are often conducted on dedicated servers provided by institutions.
Both these dedicated servers and online judgers face challenges, especially when there's a surge in submissions, leading to server overloads.

## Our Solution: EJP
EJP is designed to tackle those above challenges. By executing most of the tasks in the user's local environment, EJP allows educators to distribute and manage coding assignments with minimal server setup costs.
It's an open-source project aimed at enabling anyone to set up their learning groups, create assignments, and facilitate solutions.
Our goal is to ensure that even small-scale educational entities or those with limited budgets can effectively manage numerous coding assignments without the hefty price tag.
